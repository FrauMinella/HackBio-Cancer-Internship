#**MEXPRESS: A software that aids in visualizing expression, DNA methylation and clinical TCGA data**

A growing number of clinical and genomic cancer data has been made publicly available in recent years thanks to large-scale collaborative programs like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Cancer genome browser. Full scientific potential of these datasets will remain unrealized as long as they are hard to access and understand.

MEXPRESS is an intuitive web tool designed after the principles of graphical excellence, for the fast querying and visualization of the clinical, expression and methylation data of these available datasets and the relationship between these datasets on a single gene level. It ensures that the complex TCGA data would be presented in a clear, precise and efficient way to the user. 

#**Implementation and application of MEXPRESS**

A key feature of MEXPRESS is creating a plot which results in an image that can downloaded in a PNG or SVG file format. To create this plot, a user has to enter a gene name, select one of the available cancer types and click the plot button.

The blue line plot illustrates the methylation for each probe location, the yellow line plot displays the RNA-seq-derived expression data and the grey bar plots represent the values of clinical parameters. The numbers on the far right indicate the significance of the relation between each row of data and the selected expression value. The significance mentioned above is calculated using statistical analysis functions in MEXPRESS which include the Pearson correlation and non-parametric Wilcoxon’s rank sum test. The former is used to compare two types of data that has more than 2 level i.e., expression and methylation data while the latter is used to calculate the variable difference between two groups.

Researchers studying prostate cancer have used MEXPRESS to explore the expression of the gene GSTP1 while also investigating how its methylation status correlates with patient outcomes. In another case, the tool was used to analyze the gene MLPH a breast cancer marker, revealing how its methylation levels differ between various breast cancer subtypes and how these differences relate to its expression. 

#**Conclusion**

In conclusion, while the availability of TCGA data is a tremendous asset, its utility is maximized by platforms like MEXPRESS, which bridge the gap between data complexity and user accessibility. These insights can help uncover new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving different cancers.
