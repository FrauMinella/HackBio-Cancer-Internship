**R Shiny; a concept in frontend bioinformatics**

Front-end bioinformatics focuses on the development of interactive online applications to analyze biological datasets. One of the most widely used programming languages in data science is R, which is also utilized in biological data analysis and bioinformatics.

The Shiny, an R package was developed by the RStudio company in 2012\. R Shiny in bioinformatics allows scientists with little or no programming experience to easily create customizable web-based applications that suit specific research needs (Jia *et al*., 2021). These apps can be used to visualize and modify large-scale genomic and clinical data in the context of cancer research, allowing scientists to quickly get valuable insights and easily share their results with others (Mercatelli *et al*., 2020).

One of the applications of R Shiny in cancer is DeepDR: A user-friendly R Shiny app for predicting anti-cancer drug response using deep learning. Requiring accessible prediction models and precise therapy response prediction is necessary to advance oncology.

Wang *et al.,* (2024). Server overview of Simple DeepDR modules

Users can perform two main functions with shinyDeepDR: "Find Drug," which predicts the sample's response to 265 approved and investigational anti-cancer compounds, and "Find Sample," which looks for cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas with genomics profiles similar to those of the query sample to study potential effective treatments. Users can upload mutation and/or gene expression data from a cancer sample (cell line or tumor). An interactive interface for analyzing prediction results and looking into specific compounds is offered by shinyDeepDR (Wang *et al.,* 2024).

The modules identify drugs achieving significantly enhanced responses in tumors harboring specific gene alterations in a cancer-type-specific manner. DeepDR supports the analysis, this extended analysis provides additional insights into the potential interplay between the two genes and their impact on drug responses. The results generated by the modules are presented through a comprehensive data table and boxplots, enabling users to explore the specific drug responses, associated statistical information, and results interpretation (Wang et al., 2024). It is important to note that shinyDeepDR has its limitations, inadequate data quality has the ability to compromise prediction accuracy.

In conclusion, R Shiny offers an approachable interface which promotes the creation of more potent treatment plans and a deeper comprehension of cancer biology. It is a vital instrument in the continuous battle against cancer because of its capacity to develop dynamic, responsive applications.
